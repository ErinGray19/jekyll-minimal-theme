### Blockquotes

Biographer Graham Balfour quoted Stevenson's wife Fanny Stevenson:

> In the small hours of one morning, [...] I was awakened by cries of horror
> from Louis. Thinking he had a nightmare, I awakened him. He said angrily:
> "Why did you wake me? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale."
> I had awakened him at the first transformation scene.

Lloyd Osbourne, Stevenson's stepson, wrote: "I don't believe that there was ever such a literary feat before as the writing of Dr Jekyll.
